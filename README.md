# mitochondrial-morphology-macro
ImageJ macro for semi-automated mitochondrial morphology analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an ImageJ/FIJI macro used to assist part of the image analysis performed in the study:
"Characterizing mitochondrial phenotypes and MERCS in aged human skeletal muscle myoblasts".

The macro automates only specific steps of the analysis workflow. Several steps, including image selection and ROI definition, are performed manually by the user.

## Software Requirements
- ImageJ or FIJI
- Tested with FIJI (version not specified)

## How to Use
1. Open ImageJ or FIJI.
2. Load the image files to be analyzed.
3. Run the macro file (`.ijm`) included in this repository.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions.
5. Perform manual operations (e.g., ROI selection) when prompted.

## Notes on Reproducibility
- This macro is intended to assist image analysis and does not provide full automation.
- Manual intervention is required during processing.
- Analysis results may vary depending on user-defined parameters and manual operations.
